# unsafe-mode
 
 This repo is for a C# project centered around restarting a Windows machine to safe mode in order to bypass defences. This technique is detailed as [T1562.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/009/) by Mitre Att&ck.
 Specifically, the TTPs covered in this project is intended to emulate pre-encryption steps taken by the AvosLocker Ransomware group. However, this method is also used by REvil, and BlackMatter.
 A simple echo command is used in the RunOnce registry key for a proof of concept, but that is typically where the encryption process starts for AvosLocker.
